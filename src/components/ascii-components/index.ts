// HOW TO ADD YOUR OWN ANIMATION
//
// 1. Export your animation from the Monowave studio (React component).
// 2. Paste the downloaded .tsx file into this folder.
// 3. Import its exported constants below.
// 4. Add an entry to the ASCII_SHOWCASE array.
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

// Example — uncomment and adapt:
//
// import {
//   FRAMES as MyFrames,
//   APPEARANCE as MyAppearance,
//   FPS as MyFps,
//   CHARS as MyChars,
// } from "./my-animation";
//
// Then add to the array:
// {
//   id: "my-animation",
//   title: "My Animation",
//   description: "Short description of what it does.",
//   filename: "my-animation.tsx",
//   accentColor: "#B54B00",
//   componentName: "MyAnimation",
//   frames: MyFrames,
//   fps: MyFps,
//   chars: MyChars,
//   appearance: MyAppearance,
// },
