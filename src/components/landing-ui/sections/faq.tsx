    question: "Does my media get uploaded to a server?",

    number: "03",
    question: "How do I customise the look of my ASCII output?",

    id: "item-4",
    number: "04",
    question: "Is Monowave free to use?",

    id: "item-5",
    number: "05",
    question: "How do I request a new feature or report a bug?",
    answer:
      "Open an issue on the GitHub repository. Feature requests are prioritised by community votes, and bugs are triaged weekly. Pull requests are very welcome too!",
